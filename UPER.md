<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

- U = "Understand"
- P = "Plan"
- E = "Execute"
- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

- I need to create an ASCII based terminal game.
- It needs to follow all the core requirements in the README.
- I also want to try to attempt to fulfill the bonus requirements of the project.

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

- I already understand the game of sudoku, so I don't need to figure out the rules and research how the game works. Because of this, I will start with trying to make my user interface first. I want to have an intuitive UI to make the game easy to play. This will also work to satisfy one of the bonuses (use a 3rd party libary [ java swing ])
- After creating the UI, I will start to implement the base functionality of the game.
- Once the base functionality is created, I will look into the other bonus requirements, such as creating a front-end with react.
- If I can satisfy the bonus requirements, I will pursue those. Otherwise I will try to add more functionality to the game, like hints, highscore, etc.
